            <h3>Personal Profile</h3>
            <p>
                I am a hard working go getter who likes to get things done as
                effectively and as easily as possible. I have amazing people
                skills due to past retail experience and working in an office
                environment. I am always happy to help and will do what I can to
                do so. I am not afraid to voice my opinion if I believe that
                there is a more effective way to complete a task. I am adaptable
                and never shy away from learning new things. I already have a
                very wide variety of skills within the IT industry, this is due
                to studying IT and working within an office environment where
                computers are heavily part of day-to-day work. But also, as I
                spend a lot of my personal time on computers learning new
                things.

<h2>Top 3 Movies</h2>
<hr>
<h3>1. The Whale</h3>
<p>This movie was a masterpiece, Brendan Fraser's acting is incredible. I believe this movie resonated with me as a larger man who struggles with his weight. It was sad and eye opening to watch someone go through something even slightly similar.</p>

<h3>2. Shutter Island</h3>
<p>This movie to me was an incredible mind bending story about a man who solving the mysterious disappearance of a person of interest. Or is he? ðŸ‘€</p>

<h3>3. Avatar 2</h3>
<p>I will always remember watching the 1st Avatar movie in cinema when I was younger. This movie made me have a strong appreciation for nature.</p>
